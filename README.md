Setting the environment
-----------------------
To set the environment we have create a conda + R environment, which can be prepared by running `installation_script.sh`.
The notebook `0_sample_download_and_preprocess.ipynb` runs the content to prepare the CellRanger and Kallisto files. If you already have these files, you can set them up in the notebook.
